            THE BOOKSHELF<br>
            Bookshelf is an online community created to inspire your desire to read more books and provide you with the resources and support you need without all the pressures and overwhelm. So whether you're a self-proclaimed "non-reader" or a reader looking to live a more intentional and fulfilled reading life, you're in the right place!

        <h2>It's a Podcast, but It's Also Happy Hour</h2>
        <p>
            The Reader's Couch podcast will help you bridge the gap between living a full and busy life to one where you're reading, learning new things, and having fun! So let's discover new books, share reading tips, talk about lifestyle and wellness, and inspire and encourage each other along the way.

        <h2>Ready to join a literary community?</h2>
        <p>
            Join the Bookshelf Community for a fun, online book club experience! Come and share books you've read, get inspiration for what to read next, make friends, and encourage each other along the way. At our Bring Your Own Book (BYOB) Club, you can bring any book you wish to our monthly meetings and tell us all about it. The community hosts quarterly literary brunches, which are seasonally themed events, annual summer camp, engaging live events and workshops, plus reading and lifestyle challenges throughout the year.

            The blog is where I share reading tips, lifestyle how-to's, book lists, reading guides, share conversations with authors, offer free mini-trainings, plus all the things I'm currently obsessed with and find inspiring.
